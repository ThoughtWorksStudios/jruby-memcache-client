The motivation for me to work on this wrapper comes from the fact that in production, the standard Ruby MemCache client
can cause a thread to hang. In the Glassfish application server, by default there are 5 Grizzly connectors that handle incoming
requests. A site that uses MemCache heavily can quickly cause all Grizzly connectors to block and take down a site. I'm hoping
that this work I am doing here will help others adopt JRuby as a production platform for their Ruby on Rails applications.

As of right now this code only provides a very minimal amount of functionality, but it is enough to use with the Rails cache and cache_fu.

To use this code, copy the files in lib/* to the Rails lib/ directory. Add these lines of code to production.rb:

if defined? JRUBY_VERSION
  require 'jmem_cache_store'
  config.cache_store = JMemCacheStore.new(MEMCACHED_CONFIG['servers'])
  ActsAsCached.config[:store] = config.cache_store  
end

I have not tested this in production yet.

Dependencies:
--------------

The Java MemCache client requires log4j to work correctly. You can download log4j here:

http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/download.html

After building log4j, you'll want to put it in your classpath.

While developing, it usually makes sense to have some verbose logging to STDOUT. You can accomplish this by placing creating a file called
log4j.properties in your CLASSPATH or your RAILS_ROOT/lib directory. There is an example of this file in the properties directory of this project.

Notes:
------

- Ruby objects are serialized to YAML rather than using Marshal. The reason for this is that the character \222 deserializes weird. YAML, in my tests,
runs about 10x as slow serializing an object, and about 3x as slow deserializing.
